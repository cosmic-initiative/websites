        <p class="faq">
          <strong>FAQ</strong>: Hi, I clicked this link by accident. Just
          curious What is 'WebAssembly Orchestra Anyway?`
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>uberscott</strong>: WebAssembly <em>Orchestration.</em> It's a
          Software Framework for deploying &amp; executing WebAssembly
          everywhere!
        </p>

        <p class="faq">
          <strong>FAQ</strong>: Software!? I thought this was a new science
          fiction show!
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>uberscott</strong>: Nope, just an open source and free
          software project with an Astro Physics based theme.
        </p>

        <p class="faq">
          <strong>FAQ</strong>: No need to tell me it's free. I wasn't going to
          give you money.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>uberscott</strong>: With this Framework WebAssembly components
          can discover their environment and communicate with other resources
          including WebAssembly components that talk to other WebAssembly
          components through messaging and RPC!
        </p>
        <p>
          BTW, the kids these days sometimes refer to WebAssembly as
          <em>Wasm</em> and I want to be cool so I will be using the terms Wasm
          and WebAssembly interchangeably from here on.
        </p>

        <p class="faq">
          <strong>FAQ</strong>: This is getting out of hand! Now you're calling
          it Wasm instead of WebAssembly! The Children! What about the
          Children!? This Wasm creation of yours must be terminated forthwith!
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>uberscott</strong>: I didn't invent WebAssembly. Wasm is a
          standard created by the
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/">World Wide Web Consortium (WC3)</a>.
          Wasm is a binary instruction format for a virtual machine. It's a
          widely accepted standard that already works on all the major browsers
          and is rapidly gaining acceptance on every other layer of the stack
          including Mobile, Desktop, Server, Edge and IoT. Check out
          <a href="https://webassembly.org">webassembly.org</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          There are MANY advantages that Wasm has over containers and other
          virtual machines including an extremely small footprint, security and
          ubiquity. WebAssembly is the future and The Cosmic Initiative is just
          here to accelerate Wasm's inevitable ascension.
        </p>

        <p class="faq">
          <strong>FAQ</strong>: Well the WC3 website looks much more trustworthy
          than yours. I may have jumped the gun and called the cops on
          you--probably better not mention that you are into Wasm or they might
          arrest you.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>uberscott</strong>: Everyone wants Wasm on every layer of the
          stack and that is what The Cosmic Initiative is here to facilitate:
          the deployment, configuration, execution, and interoperability of
          these Wasm components across every Layer of the stack! To boil it down
          to one word we just call this Orchestration. The Framework is written
          in Rust so it can be compiled and run anywhere! ... OUCH!
        </p>

        <p class="faq">
          <strong>FAQ</strong>: Sorry! Didn't mean to hit you. That's an
          involuntary tick I have with my right punching arm when someone says
          he or she is a Rust developer.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>uberscott</strong>: A lot of people seem to have that tick...
          Anyway the framework also allows these Wasm components to interact
          with other resources like File Systems and Databases and really any
          Resource in the enterprise that has a Cosmic Initiative driver
          implementation.
        </p>

        <p class="faq">
          <strong>FAQ</strong>: Good God man! You have turned my beloved Wasm
          into a monster! Tell me you have put safeguards in place to prevent
          these Wasms from becoming sentient and overthrowing us! Don't Make me
          invoke the children a second time!
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>uberscott</strong>: WebAssembly is itself very secure because
          it only allows host method invocation to white listed methods AND this
          framework is built upon the
          <a href="https://wasmer.io">Wasmer</a> host which is itself super cool
          and secure! Interactions between Wasm components occur via The Cosmic
          Fabric--which has many responsibilities including routing messages and
          managing a registry to locate component addresses-- The Cosmic Fabric
          also enforces security.
        </p>

        <p class="faq">
          <strong>FAQ</strong>: This will never work because even though the
          illuminati is trying to make everyone say the made up word
          <em>`DevOps`</em> we all know deep down that the Dev folk like to
          deliver naughty code to Ops just for meanness because they can't
          forgive the Ops folk for not allowing them fully descend into a mad
          fantasy that hardware and service configuration doesn't exist and the
          world is only software.
        </p>

        <p>
          There are some feuds that this humble open source project doesn't
          pretend to be capable of solving. Yet there is some mitigation:
        </p>
        <p>
          All concepts in the framework exist in one of two "dimensions": The
          <em>Universe</em> or The <em>Hyperverse</em>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Wasm components experience the Cosmic Fabric through the Universal API
          which allows the component to interact with it as if was on a single
          infinitely vast computer with no security.
        </p>
        <p class="faq">
          <strong>FAQ</strong>: So it's NOT secure! The Children! Thricely thou
          hast made me invoketh the children!
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>uberscott</strong>: Security is still enforced. The Universal
          code simply doesn't need to be aware of security.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example let's talk authorization: If a source Wasm component sends
          a message to a target Wasm component and the target Wasm component
          requires authorization--the source Wasm simply sends the message
          without credentials or tokens or anything... It behaves as if there IS
          no security. Behind the scenes as the message traverses the Cosmic
          Fabric it enters the Hyperversal dimension and the source's
          authorization is checked and the message is either passed to the
          target or rejected to the source.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that the target component which is also part of the Universal
          dimension makes no effort to authorize the request--it simply assumes
          that any message it receives must be authorized or else it would not
          have been delivered.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, the two dimensional isolation of concerns will collide in
          the case when the source Wasm component does NOT have permission to
          message the target Wasm component. For this reason the Universe is not
          completely unaware of the Hyperverse, but at least there is a vast
          simplification on the code on both end.
        </p>
        <p>
          As you can see it's really about moving the common and oft duplicated
          complexities away from the multitude of component endpoints to a
          single place in between the components.
        </p>

        <p class="faq">
          <strong>FAQ</strong>: That last part was long and reading it has made
          my eyes hurt.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>uberscott</strong>: There are many other examples of
          complexities besides security that are managed by the Hyperversal
          dimension such as provisioning, sharding and load balancing to name a
          few.
        </p>

        <p class="faq">
          <strong>FAQ</strong>: Hey! I just realized something! The word
          Framework can be broken down into two words: "Frame" and "Work"...
          And, well, I guess I got no problem with "Frame", but "Work"! That's
          that thing that I hate!
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>uberscott</strong>: You might be interested in the reference
          implementation of the framework in development called
          <a href="http://starlane.io"
            ><span class="starlane">STARLANE</span>:
            <strong
              >A Mesh for extending enterprise resources with
              WebAssembly</strong
            ></a
          >.
        </p>

        <p class="faq">
          <strong>FAQ</strong>: Oh so The Cosmic Initiative is just a framework
          for making Meshes... Why didn't you say that in the first place?
        </p>
        <p class="faq">
          I could have been enriching myself by watching amusing cat videos on
          YouTube if you had just said it was a Mesh from the start!
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>uberscott</strong>: The Cosmic Initiative is a framework for
          Orchestrating WebAssembly components and one application of the
          framework is a Mesh. I have plans for a 2nd reference implementation
          which is a stand alone application for mobile devices that makes use
          of the deployment capabilities so small parts of the overall
          application can be changed as needed.
        </p>

        <p class="faq">
          <strong>FAQ</strong>: I see. I still kinda wish I had watched those
          cat videos.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>uberscott</strong>: More importantly The Cosmic Initiative is
          a collection of Rust packages for composing WebAssembly Orchestration
          apps which means there is code for messaging, artifacting,
          configuration and more. I'm excited by the prospect that other
          developers may use these packages to create new applications that even
          I didn't imagine.
        </p>

        <p class="faq">
          <strong>FAQ</strong>: Yeah, I'm not really a big Rust fan since I
          don't like being nagged by a compiler telling me I don't own something
          I used in the very previous line...
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>uberscott</strong>: Wasm is polyglot so you can compile Wasm
          binaries from most of the major languages. The Cosmic Initiative will
          provide auto generated serde models of all the important Universal
          concepts to the most widely used programming languages.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also, aside from extending the Cosmos with Wasm components you can
          also create a Control component to exposes a traditional API endpoint
          from external services. The Control endpoints also enable you to add
          Wasm to your existing architecture gradually without throwing out the
          entire enterprise and starting over.... You simply add a Control
          client API library to an existing service and start sending messages
          to Wasm components that live inside the Cosmos.
        </p>
        <p>
          The rational for using Rust for the framework is that Rust is super
          fast, super robust and has a small footprint. Of course all languages
          make trade offs in order to shine at something--in the case of Rust
          its fantastic benefits are achieved by a compiler that sucks the very
          sanity out of the developer producing a binary and the empty husk of a
          coder as byproduct.
        </p>

        <p class="faq">

          Anyway, You should now understand enough about The Cosmic Initiative
          to make an informed decision as to if you want to learn more or slink
          off into the oblivion of the internet to pursue You Tube's rich bounty
          of amusing cat videos and you should make the best choice for yourself
          to further enrich your life. I hope you will dig deeper into the
          project, learn how to work with
